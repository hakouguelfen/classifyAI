### TODO:
-  check if there is outliers for report, plot them
### NOTES:
- there are alot of outliers in insu attribute (374)
- use log transformation
- don't use fill missing values, because they are not missing, they are 0
- good for KNN:{'rand': 121, 'k': 91, 'precision': 0.94} 
- Naive bayesian: {'rand': 452, 'precision': 0.85}
